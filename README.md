# COP-3502: Computer Science 1 [C]
UCF Fall 2021

Professor: Arup Guha


Description: Big O analysis and Data Structures. This course continues off where COP3223C left off, reviewing dynamic memory allocation and structures. The course then continues to teach about Big O analysis and introduce algorithms that make coding more efficient. This course also goes over the following data structures & algorithms:
  
  Recursion: Goes over in details and discusses its time and space complexity.
    -> Additionally: Touches on DFS using recursion but does not go indepth COP3503 topic
    
  Stacks: Goes over in detail of how to use them
  Queues: Goes over in detail of how to use them
    -> Aditionall: Touces on DFS and BFS using stacks/queues but does not go indepth COP3503 topic
